# Lab 3: Combinational Circuit Simulation Using QuestaSim

## Tasks
1. **Implement and Simulate Logic Circuit (Fig. 3.17)**  
   - Write SystemVerilog RTL and testbench code.  
   - Simulate in QuestaSim and verify the truth table.  

2. **Full Adder Compilation and Error Fixing**  
   - Compile the Full Adder RTL and testbench in QuestaSim.  
   - Identify and correct errors.  
   - Re-run the simulation to verify the fix.
